## Deployment

The application is configured for continuous deployment with AWS Amplify:

1. Commit your changes to the repository
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Deploy using Amplify
   ```bash
   amplify publish
   ```

## Security Considerations

The platform implements several security measures:
- Role-based access control with Cognito
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- WAF for API Gateway protection
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- Security Hub for compliance monitoring

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile application for on-the-ground volunteers
- Offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity
- Integration with weather and disaster alert systems
